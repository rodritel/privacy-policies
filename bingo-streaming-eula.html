        <p class="subtitle">Bingo Streaming &mdash; Twitch Extension &bull; Last updated: February 20, 2026</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>By installing or using the Bingo Streaming Extension ("the Extension"), you agree to be bound by the terms of this End User License Agreement ("EULA"). If you do not agree, do not use the Extension.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. License Grant</h2>
        <p>The developer grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Extension on the Twitch platform for its intended purpose: playing bingo during live streams.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of the Extension</h2>

            <li>Have numbers automatically or manually marked as they are called by the broadcaster</li>
            <li>Claim bingo when a winning pattern is completed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Extension is provided as entertainment only. No real money, prizes, or gambling is involved unless explicitly stated by the broadcaster independently of this Extension.</p>

        <h2>3. Restrictions</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Extension</li>
            <li>Modify, adapt, or create derivative works based on the Extension</li>
            <li>Use the Extension for any illegal, fraudulent, or unauthorized purpose</li>
            <li>Attempt to manipulate game results, exploit bugs, or interfere with other users' experience</li>
            <li>Use automated tools, bots, or scripts to interact with the Extension</li>
            <li>Redistribute or resell the Extension or any part of it</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The Extension, including its code, design, graphics, and documentation, is the intellectual property of the developer. This EULA does not transfer any ownership rights to you. All rights not expressly granted are reserved.</p>

        <h2>5. Twitch Platform</h2>
        <p>The Extension operates within the Twitch platform and is subject to:</p>
